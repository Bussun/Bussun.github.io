# Bussun's Website
Website website

Seriously though this *was* the GitHub repository of my (somewhat) personnal website.
I created it to display some of my projects (some of which are on GitHub). It (more or less) served as a personal portfolio. I have now moved to my own domain: [My new website](https://bussun.dev)

I'm keeping this a bit beacause some of my software depends on it for updates. Once most *users* ~~if I have any, actually~~ get an update that relies on my new website (I'm talink about the Luma editor btw), I'll just delete this repository.
