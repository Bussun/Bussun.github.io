# Bussun's Website
Website website

Seriously though this *was* the GitHub repository of my (somewhat) personnal website.
I created it to display some of my projects (some of which are on GitHub). It (more or less) served as a personal portfolio. I will move to my own domain: [My new domain](https://bussun.dev)
